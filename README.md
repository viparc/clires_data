The `make_data.R` R script that generates the data can be generated by
the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("knitr")
knitr::purl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/make_data.Rmd", documentation = 1L)
```

The data set, as a flat rectangular CSV file, can be downloaded from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/data/viparc.csv):

``` r
# install.packages("readr")
viparc <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/data/viparc.csv",
                          col_types = paste(c("ciillidddllllll", rep("d", 45)), collapse = ""))
```

The data frame contains 5566 weeks of observation (rows) and 60
variables (columns). The variables are

  - **farm:** farm ID;
  - **flock:** flock ID (in a given farm);
  - **week:** week number (in a given flock of a given farm);
  - **sampling:** boolean informing whether there is feces sampling
    during the week (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`);
  - **completed:** boolean informing whether the flock is done (`TRUE`)
    or still ongoing (`FALSE`);
  - **nb\_chicken:** total number of chicken in the farm;
  - **nb\_chicken\_sold:** total number of chicken sold from the farm;
  - **chicken\_disease\_death** number of chicken in the farm that died
    from disease between the previous and the current weeks;
  - **chicken\_sudden\_death** number of chicken in the farm that
    suddenly died (from other causes than the disease) between the
    previous and the current weeks;
  - **respiratory, …, sudden\_death:** presence (`TRUE`) / absence
    (`FALSE`) of 6 clinical signs in the flock;
  - **chicken\_disease\_death**: number of chicken dying from disease
    between the previous and the current weeks;
  - **chicken\_sudden\_death**: number of chicken suddenly dying (from
    other cause than disease) between the previous and the current
    weeks;
  - **amoxicillin\_g, …, unknown\_g:** mass, in g, of the 44
    antimicriobial used in the flock.

In addition, there is also information on the antimicrobial class of
each antimicrobial used in the data set. These data can be download from
here:

``` r
ab_classes <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/data/antimicrobial_classes.csv", col_types = "cc")
```
